A hodge podge test game to learn unity
Written in C# using the unity engine

# General things to keep in mind to get your code merged
1. TRUE/FALSE defines for booleans not 1/0
2. 8. No magic numbers, no magic strings, etc etc etc. Define everything with #define so we don't cry over unreadable/spaghetti code later.
3. Make sure your code can handle the unexpected. For example some procs CAN fail!
4. No quick and dirty hard coding where possible, this is a testbed to learn, so it's a good idea to have everything object orentated, rather than learn that later.
5. When making a PR, update the documentation with new procs/documentation if you expect anyone else will use what you coded.
6. No comments, no merge.
7. No self merging please.
8. Try to use markdown in text documents
